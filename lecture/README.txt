1. Make fallback implementation of OTSU algorithm in case something goes wrong.
2. Determine lecture content:
	- Write function to compute histogram (vectorized bumpy version)
	- Implement otsu
3. Use otsu implementation
	- Threshold bie image
	- Demonstrate how to remove unwanted image objects by filtering region labeling of 	BLOBs and using BLOB shape metrics.
